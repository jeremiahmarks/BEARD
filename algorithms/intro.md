#A quick run through of what an algorithm is:
Let's agree that an algorithm is a series of steps that need to be taken to guarentee a result. 

To Barney-style it for you:

* An algorithm must end, it must come to a result. 
* For it to be a good algorithm the result must be "correct"
    * If designed to find the sum of one and one the algorithm should not return three

#Sharing Algorithms

Algorithms are frequently shared in a way that transends language as it can be directly implemented in any language, [psuedocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode). This makes it easy to describe the series of steps to someone with little to no experience in your language.
